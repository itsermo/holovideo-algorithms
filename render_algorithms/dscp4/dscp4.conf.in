; the render mode, acceptable values are:
;
; "viewing" - will output the 3D model to a normal OpenGL window,
;             useful for looking at 3D model input data and debugging.
; "stereogram" - will output tiled view texture of multiple scene views to an OpenGL window,
;              useful for debugging the panoramagram, seeing what's in the buffers.
; "holovideo" - creates and outputs the computed fringe patterns from stereograms.
; 				(this is the default option, and must
;				 be selected to show proper image on Mark IV)
